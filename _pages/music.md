# 🎵 Music

Music is an indispensable part of my life. From the soulful melodies of R&B to the rhythmic beats of Hiphop, from the improvisational freedom of Jazz to the warm resonance of Soul, every song carries different emotions and memories. Here, I want to share with you the music and artists that have deeply touched my heart.

## 🎤 R&B - The Rhythm of the Soul

R&B is more than just a music genre to me—it's a vessel for emotions. Those heartfelt melodies and delicate vocals always strike the softest parts of the soul.

### Khalil Fong - The Eternal Music Poet

> **R.I.P. Khalil Fong** 🙏

Khalil Fong's passing deeply saddens me. He was a true musical genius who left us countless classics with his unique musical language. From "Love Love Love" to "Three People," from "Wonderland" to "Future," his music was always so pure and sincere. His departure is a tremendous loss to the Chinese music scene, but his music will forever accompany us, becoming eternal memories in our hearts. May he continue to express his love and dreams through music in another world.

When it comes to R&B, how can we not mention the legendary Stevie Wonder? His music spans over half a century, from "Superstition" to "Isn't She Lovely," from "I Just Called to Say I Love You" to "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"—each song is a classic among classics. He has proven through music that true art can transcend time, language, and all boundaries.

### David Tao - The Pioneer of Chinese R&B

David Tao is the irreplaceable godfather of R&B in my heart. From "Find Myself" to "Love, Very Simple," from "Ordinary Friend" to "Just Love You," each of his songs is like a meticulously crafted work of art. He uses music to interpret what true "Tao-style love songs" are—combining Western rhythm with Eastern emotional delicacy. His music has accompanied me through countless nights, and those melodies still resonate in my heart.
