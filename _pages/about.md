# 🗺️ About Me

Hello, I'm **Songyang Peng**, an incoming **Ph.D. student (Fall 2026)** in **Computer Science** currently pursuing my **M.E. in Computer Technology** at **Fudan University**. I am also a **Co-Founder of [Apeat AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apeat-ai/)**, an AI startup building LLM-native applications for productivity and automation.

My research interests include **AI System Security**, **AI Safety**, and **LLM inference systems**. To date, I have published papers at top-tier conferences including **USENIX Security 2026** and **VehicleSec 2025**, and I currently have two first-author papers (**FSE 26'**, **ICML 26'**) and one co-authored paper (**IEEE TIFS 26'**) under review, wish me good luck 🙏.

Previously, I worked as an LLM Inference Engineer Intern at **[ByteDance, Ark](https://www.volcengine.com/product/ark)**, contributing to high-performance LLM serving and agent infrastructure. Before that, I was an AI Research Intern at **[Tencent, IEG](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)**, where I developed generative scene creation tools in Unreal Engine using LLMs and procedural content generation (PCG).
